# My project to a technical test: develop two micro service, authentification and a basic CRUD

## How to use this app?
1. Clone the project
2. Install the dependencies
* run npm install in the root, authentification and crud directories
3. Create an .`env` at the root and fill it (use `.env.example` as an example)
4. Start the app
* Run at the root `npm run dev`

## What it is about?
This is a project I developed to respond to a technical test during a recruiting process to develop two micro service, one is about authentification and the second one is a basic CRUD

### authentification
This is a 3 endpoints API
1. /user
* To post a new user
* To get all users
2. /Login (1st authentification step)
* To log the app: The app will send a 4 digits code to the user email
3. /validation (2nd authentification step)
* To post the 4 digits code and receive the token

### crud
This is a 1 endpoint API /product
1. To post a new product
2. To get one specific product
3. To get all products
4. To update one specific product
5. To remove one specific product

## How to work in development and production Environment?
- In development environment, the microservice will use Environment variables defined in the file `.env`
- In production environment, the microservice will use Environment variables defined in the production environment (AWS, Herokuâ€¦)

### To run in development environment
1. Create and fill a file `.env` (at the root). One example is available `.env.example` at the root
2. Execute `npm run dev`   

### To run in production environment
1. Define the Environment variable in production `NODE_ENV = production`
2. Define in production environment all Environment variables used by the app (list of is available `.env.example` at the root)

## How to perform the tests?
* Tests are inside the authentification/tests
* To run the tests, inside the directory authentification, 
1. Execute `npm run dev`
2. Execute `npm test`
